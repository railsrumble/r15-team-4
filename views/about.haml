%h5 Ever wondered what kind of kitten your Github repo would be?

Well, okay, maybe you didn't, but it doesn't hurt to know.
On a more serious note,
%blockquote gittens provides a way to size up a Github repo at a glance
how mature is it, how well-maintained? It has probably happened to you too: you're looking for a library, find two that do the exact same thing and they look kind of equal in most ways. Looking at the gitten of the repo, though, the differences will suddenly seem striking.

%p
  Check out, say,
  %a{href: '/gitten/peter-murach/github', target: '_blank'} peter-murach/github
  and
  %a{href: '/gitten/octokit/octokit.rb', target: '_blank'} octokit/octokit.rb
  and see for yourself!

%h5 What makes a gitten?

%p
  The
  %strong age
  of the gitten is determined how long the repo has been around: they can be newborn (like
  %a{href: '/gitten/railsrumble/r15-team-4', target: '_blank'} gittens
  itself at the time of writing), but there are some truly
  %a{href: '/gitten/git/git', target: '_blank'} senior gittens
  around too.

%p
  The physical size of the repo detemines the
  %strong size
  of the gitten; sometimes useful to know before cloning.

%p
  The more contributors the repo has, the more
  %strong colorful
  the gitten will be.

%p
  A gitten is as well-fed as the repo is well-maintained: too many open issues, unmerged pull-requests, and a slow rate of dealing with them will make the gitten feel
  %strong hungrier
  and hungrier for attention.

%p
  People actively working on the repo will make the gitten more and more
  %strong active.
  Repos untouched since ages will sport hibernating gittens, like
  %a{href: '/gitten/activerecord-hackery/squeel', target: '_blank'} activerecord-hackery/squeel
  for example, and actively developed projects will have a playful, active gitten.

%p
  The more attention and stars the repo gets, the more
  %strong amused
  the gitten will become.

%h5 Badges

%p
  Gittens provides badges to include in your repo README, so you can show off your cute gitten to everyone.
  These badges feaure a short description of the gitten, based on it's two most important or outstanding qualities, making it even easier to get a feel for the state of the repository.
  %p
    If you see a
    %a{href: '/gitten/activerecord-hackery/squeel', target: '_blank'}
      %img{src: '/badge/activerecord-hackery/squeel'}
    you know there are issues needing attention for sure, but there hasn't been any activity in a long time.
  %p
    But if you see a
    %a{href: '/gitten/rails/rails', target: '_blank'}
      %img{src: '/badge/rails/rails'}
    you know it's and old repository with lots and lots of contributiors, and since these are it's two standout traits, the other areas should be okay, so it's probably an actively developed and nicely maintained repository.

%h5 How does it work?
%p The ratings assigned to gittens are calculated by highly sophisticated algorithms developed by kitty scientists in an underground fortress on the Moon.
%p
  The app uses the Github API to get data about repos, and since it's not requiring any sort of login, it's possible that you'll run into the
  %a{href: 'https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/', target: '_blank'} Github API rate limits
  \.

%p
  The badges are generated by
  %a{href: 'shields.io', target: '_blank'} shields.io
  ,
  and the ASCII kittens were inspired by
  %a{href: '/gitten/melaniecebula/cat-ascii-faces', target: '_blank'} melaniecebula/cat-ascii-faces
  \.
